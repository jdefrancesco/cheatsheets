# Determine if firmware blob is compressed or encrypted:
In general:
    * Very accurate MonteCarlo Pi approx. are sure signs of ENCRYPTION (<0.01%)
    * Large deviations in Chi Dist or large Pi error calculations are sure signs of COMPRESSION
    * High Chi (>300), Low Pi (<0.03%) - ENCRYPTION
    * Low Chi (<300), High Pi (>0.03%) - COMPRESSION

# binwalk calculate entropy
$ binwalk -E firmware.blob 

# ent command
ent  blob.bin

# 24MB File Encrypted/Compressed for reference values
Alg=None, Chi 15048.60, Pi=0.920%
Alg=AES, Chi=351.68, Pi=0.022%
Alg=3DES, Chi=357.50, Pi=0.029%
Alg=LZMA, Chi=253.54, Pi=0.032%
Alg=GZIP, Chi 11814.28, Pi=0.765% 

- Most of those results follow the general rules. GZIP has a high Chi which  is misleading, high Pi gives it away
  at 0.765%

- LZMA follows the general advice well Chi < 300, Pi a tiny bit over 0.03%. The morale, make sure you look at both values.

The more data the better results obviously.
